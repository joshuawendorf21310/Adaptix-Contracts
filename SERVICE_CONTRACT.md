# Adaptix-Contracts Service Contract

## Purpose
Publish shared request/response/event schemas used across Adaptix services.

## Contract Rules
- Schemas must be versioned.
- Breaking changes must be coordinated across consumers.
- Runtime services must import the real package, not a local mock.
- Contract tests must cover required fields, optional fields, validation errors, and backwards compatibility where promised.

## Data Ownership
This package owns schema definitions only. It does not own persisted domain data.

## Failure Contract
Import failures, mismatched schema versions, and mock package usage are production blockers.
