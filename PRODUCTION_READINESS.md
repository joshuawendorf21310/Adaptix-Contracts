# Adaptix-Contracts Production Readiness

Date: 2026-05-08
Classification: PASS

## Service Purpose
Shared Python package for cross-service schemas and contract publication truth.

## Exposed Routes
No runtime HTTP routes. This repo publishes package-level schemas/contracts consumed by services.

## Dependencies
Python packaging, downstream service imports, semantic versioning, and CI publication process.

## Secrets Required
Package publication credentials if publishing to a private index. No runtime secrets expected.

## Database/Migration State
No database ownership.

## Integration Dependencies
All service repos that import shared schemas.

## Health/Readiness Endpoint Status
No HTTP endpoint applies because this repo is a library. Readiness is defined by:
- `python validate_contracts.py`
- `python validate_contracts.py --json`
- `python -m pytest`
- `python -m build --sdist --wheel`
- `python -m twine check dist/*`
- `python scripts/audit_workspace_contracts.py --workspace-root <workspace>`

## Test Status
Local validator and regression suite pass in this repo. Focused consumer validation also passed after removing the Core, Inventory, Narcotics, and Integrations shadow `adaptix_contracts` trees.

## Deployment Status
The package is locally buildable, CI verifies publishable artifacts, and the workspace audit now proves canonical-package adoption across the audited consumer repos.

## Production Blockers
- None for the audited workspace slice.

## Remediation Completed
- Existing shared contract package identified as authority path.
- Added machine-readable validation output via `validate_contracts.py --json`.
- Added workspace shadow-package audit script.
- Added CI artifact build and `twine check` verification.
- Added `.env.example` for workspace audit configuration.

## Final Verdict
PASS — the canonical package is validated, buildable, and proven authoritative across the audited workspace.
